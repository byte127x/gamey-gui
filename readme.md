## Welcome to Gamey GUI (Gamey Desktop)
![Gamey Desktop GUI Screenshott](https://i.imgur.com/RbgEoBo.png)

Welcome! This is gamey, an app that is based off of BlueMaxima's flashpoint, but is not only more lightweight, but also supports server changing and the running of native Windows apps!

If you plan to run the source code, you should install these dependencies first
> Tkinter 8.6+ and ttkbootstrap (GUI)
> 
> and Requests (connecting to servers and downloading files)

You can install some using `pip`
```
pip install ttkbootstrap
pip install requests
```
but tkinter may have to be installed via other means. I would recommend using the [Python for Windows installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) with the option "tcl/tk and IDLE" enabled.

This program is still in development (it's still in *alpha*)
so, be sure to report any bugs you have with the software to my email! (celctic.tribes@gmail.com)

Bye!
